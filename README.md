## Installation

### CSS quick start (easy)

- [Download the stylesheet](https://dephraiim.github.io/markdown/dist/css/markdown.css) or use the CDN URL: [https://unpkg.com/markdown-css/dist/css/markdown.css](https://unpkg.com/markdown-css/dist/css/markdown.css).
- Save the stylesheet and link to it in the head of your project.

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://unpkg.com/markdown-css/dist/css/markdown.css"
/>
```

It's all set to go and your HTML elements will be given sensible default styling.

### Sass integration (recommended)

The beauty of Markdown is the ease with which you can create unique designs in a beautiful, simple system. Simply clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dephraiim/markdown.git
cd markdown
```

And run a Sass watch on the project.

```bash
npm run sass
```
